To allow developers to use the latest language features without worrying about browser or environment constraints, `Extension` relies on [[Babel]] to transpile cutting-edge JavaScript and TypeScript code, ensuring broad compatibility and enabling developers.

## Feature Support

In addition to regular `*.js` files, `Extension` also supports the following file extensions:

| feature name | description | extension|
|-|-|-|
| [[ECMAScript Modules]] | ECMASCript modules are the official standard format to package JavaScript code for reuse. | *.js, *.mjs |
| [[TypeScript]] | TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types. | *.ts, *.tsx, *.mts, *.mtsx |
| [[React]] | React is the library for web and native user interfaces. | *.jsx, *.mjsx |

## Next Steps

* To maintain compatibility across diverse browser vendors, see [[Polyfill]].
