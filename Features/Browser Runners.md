Browser Runners allow developers to run their extension against multiple browser targets with built-in integration with the extension bundle, and offer support for useful commands such as setting up the default home page.

Features: 
- Zero-config auto-reload for [virtually everything](https://github.com/cezaraugusto/webpack-run-chrome-extension/issues/4) including all HTML overrides, and every resource you plan to require via `<script>` and `<link>` in manifest declared HTML pages.
- Fresh profile with developer mode enabled by default on every run. (customizable)
- Opens the handy "chrome://extensions" by default for fast debugging.
- Uses the system browser instead of fully downloading Chrome. (accepts Canary builds)
- Closing the webpack process instantly kills all child processes. No extra steps to open/close Chrome.
- Supports [virtually all Chrome flags](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/).
