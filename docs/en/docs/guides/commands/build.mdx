**Responsible for building the extension in production mode.** Builds the extension
for production, based on the browser choice. The `build/` folder will include as
many subfolders as the user browser choices. Each subfolder includes the code for
that specific browser, with proper code transforms for each platform.

Users can also opt for a different port to run their extensions. Defaults to `:8889`.
