**Responsible for running your extension in `production` mode.** Gets the extension
and bundles in a new browser instance. Browser extension files are watched and live-reloaded
as they change.

If a URL is provided, `Extension` will download and run the extension in the current working directory and follow the same tasks any other local extension would. _This feature only works for [GitHub](https://github.com) repositories currently_.

The target browser determines which browser they want to run their extension. Setting it to `"all"` will open all available browsers at once. If the user doesn't have the target browser installed, `Extension will throw a compiler error.

Users can also opt for a different port to run their extensions.
